Alvi Paas integrates with Docker Compose and Docker Stack to provide flexible deployment solutions. Whether you are developing locally or deploying at scale, Alvi Paas facilitates application management through these powerful Docker tools.

### Configuration Methods

Alvi Paas provides two methods for creating Docker Compose configurations:

- **Docker Compose**: Ideal for standard Docker Compose configurations.
- **Stack**: Geared towards orchestrating applications using Docker Swarm. Note that some Docker Compose features, such as `build`, are not available in this mode.

### General

Configure the source of your code, the way your application is built, and also manage actions like deploying, updating, and deleting your application, and stopping it.

### Enviroment

A code editor within Alvi Paas allows you to specify environment variables for your Docker Compose file. By default, Alvi Paas creates a `.env` file in the specified Docker Compose file path.

### Monitoring

Monitor each service individually within Alvi Paas. If your application consists of multiple services, each can be monitored separately to ensure optimal performance.

### Logs

Access detailed logs for each service through the Alvi Paas log viewer, which can help in troubleshooting and ensuring the stability of your services.

### Deployments

You can view the last 10 deployments of your application. When you deploy your application in real time, a new deployment record will be created and it will gradually show you how your application is being built.

We also offer a button to cancel deployments that are in queue. Note that those in progress cannot be canceled.

We provide a webhook so that you can trigger your own deployments by pushing to your GitHub, Gitea, GitLab, Bitbucket repository.

### Advanced

This section provides advanced configuration options for experienced users. It includes tools for custom commands within the container and volumes.

- **Command**: Alvi Paas has a defined command to run the Docker Compose file, ensuring complete control through the UI. However, you can append flags or options to the command.
- **Volumes**: To ensure data persistence across deployments, configure storage volumes for your application.

<Callout title="Volumes">
Docker volumes are a way to persist data generated and used by Docker containers. They are particularly useful for maintaining data between container restarts or for sharing data among different containers.

To bind a volume to the host machine, you can use the following syntax in your docker-compose.yml file, but this way will clean up the volumes when a new deployment is made:

```yaml
volumes:
  - "/folder:/path/in/container" ❌
```

It's recommended to use the ../files folder to ensure your data persists between deployments. For example:

```yaml
volumes:
  - "../files/my-database:/var/lib/mysql" ✅
  - "../files/my-configs:/etc/my-app/config" ✅
```

</Callout>
